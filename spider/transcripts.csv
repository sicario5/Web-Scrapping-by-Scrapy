eastern museum.,I hope to prove to the scientific world,that the Buttes are the natural habitat,of the extinct dinosaur and,other prehistoric fauna.,You don't say?,Yes indeed.,I'm finding quite a boneyard.,A place of desolation where,any creature might die,and remain undisturbed,,undiscovered for a million years.,A perfect paradise for my purpose.,Well, I guess the Buttes is,a kind of a boneyard alright.,Say, if you find any bones,or hides of the Bar 20 stock,,I wish you'd let me know.,Alright here Professor.,Thanks.,I hope you'll forgive any,embarrassment I caused.,Eh, maybe.,But I

hill.,Say, what about Keno?,Oh, leave him there.,Cassidy'll find him.,And if he does, what then?,Always get your opponent,in the jumpy frame of mind.,You have the psychological,advantage of 'em.,You know Blackie, nature,has a peculiar way,of preserving a biological balance.,Yeah.,That's right Chief.,Ornithology is the,most interesting study.,Take that buzzard for instance.,There's a useful institution.,What better coffin could any man desire,than one which flies?,Blackie, did you ever wish you had wings?,Say, I ain't aiming to ride in no clouds,nor clang no harp.,Don't worry Blackie, ya

sample,of what happens to people,that can't keep their running irons,off of Bar 20 stock.,I should have made such a mistake.,Oh we all make mistakes.,But some of us don't make 'em twice.,I can't understand it.,Say, did you come here,to visit me or Horace?,Where's your shadow?,- Huh?,- Windy.,He's always at your heels.,Oh Windy.,Oh he's got hay fever.,I left him over at the Bar 20.,Now Artie,

at Bar 20?,Because rustlers are,raiding the Bar 20 stock.,And they're using your,brand to cover their tracks.,Then I'm under suspicion?,I'm in the Buttes to,find the guilty party.,I'm afraid you'll have to,prove what you say, Mr. Cassidy.,I aim to.,And Windy is part of my plan.,Artie!,Thanks Windy.,Yeah.,I can't leave ya now, son,,but it's sure knocks Hoppy's,plan higher than a kite.,You know

Nine Meals from Chaos (2018) - full transcript,"Eight years after a cataclysm and disease ravaged the human race - leaving just one in every ten surviving -, all social structures have crumbled like sand castles. Too few still live for anything to have been reconstructed. All remaining animals have been consumed and no sowing has yet been possible. It is Man at his most basic, destitute level. Two groups inhabit the desolate and abandoned land: packs of orphaned children in a feral state, living a nomadic life-style for their safety, and adults (with their offspring), barely surviving any better by living off their meat. It is a war only the most desperate of the two will win.","There's no future for mankind.,Scientists, philosophers, writers...,all seem to agree.,Humans, simply put, are wired up wrong.,They destroy more easily than they build.,They harbor a need to kill.,They are parasites on the land they occupy.,They are that child,who spends an afternoon on the beach,building a beautiful sandcastle...,then gleefully destroying it,in a few seconds...,and feeling prouder of,the latter achievement.,

,Thousands of years of history,have proved this simple truth.,-- Subs OCR'ed+transcribed, corrected and resynced by darthfrede --,Those who think humans have progressed to,anything higher than,a dangerous and selfish animal...,they either don't know history...,or are fooled by the thin veneer of civility,they display in times of peace.,Not many survived.,Either through,the direct impact of the cataclysm,,fleeing to find death elsewhere,,or by the rampant diseases that easily spread,over the next ten years.,That is how fragile a society,almost exclusively structured around machines is.,It took just ten years to reach this point.,Ten short years to lose all social,,

,legal and agricultural structures.,Ten years for them,to consume every living animal available...,and revert back one thousand years.,There was no critical mass of people anymore,to generate new structures,or rule the chaos.,All forms of organized plantation,turned into overgrown weeds.,Cannibalism has been justified,as a necessity.,From this,,an uncountable number of children became orphaned.,Stop!,These groups of parentless children,are forced to a nomadic lifestyle...,for their own safety.,Wandering aimlessly in groups,,they seek only sustenance,,but also shelter...,and those who attempt,to survive off of them.,Having been the recipient in the last generation of,a cotton wool treatment of excessive chemical medication,,they have lost the kind of natural protection from diseases,that animals naturally have.,They die of the slightest infection.,What's your name?,Tisha.,The children left their towns and cities,that became useless and uninhabitable.,Only the countryside would offer them,any possibility at all of survival...,and protection.,One could say,these children were ""hunter-gatherers""...,without the necessary experience,the ancient generations had.,The insensitivity of taste,had already kicked in...,and any source of protein,was gladly consumed without complaint.,Besides, it did their bodies better good,than their own parents' hormoned, fatted nutrition...,that often caused their deaths from excess.,He fell in one of those traps.,We only light fires at night.,Otherwise, they'll see the smoke.,Look, guys!,Gimme!,Gimme!,They're rats.,Parasites.,Where did mum go again?,I don't know.,The first twelve years of humans,are ones of play...,play being the very essence of them.,No amount of formal schooling,can take that simple instinct away from young humans.,It is inspiring, even emotional, to see how,,even in the worst circumstances,,their ability at play.,Playing like nothing else existed.,Lolo...,Lolo.,Where did you find the carrots?,No.,Where did you find the carrots?,No.,Where?,Every method,was used to catch these children...,who were,,conveniently for those who preyed on them,,relegated to the level of parasites.,This is a term that historically,has been repeatedly used by humans,to justify their cruelties towards others.,Shall we go now?,Let's wait.,Yet, direct conflict with these so-called ""parasites"",was deemed too dangerous...,both for their ability,to outnumber their predators...,and their extreme viciousness.,Go get the body.,Where?,Go and get it!,Moralless, hungry children in numbers,under threat,are without doubt the most vicious,and agile kind among our species.,Go play somewhere else.,Go!,And your friends?,They left.,Where?,I don't want to go on.,I want to stay here

Epecu.,And how do you know that?,I came from there.,All we have to do,is follow the train tracks.,Sure.,Whatever you say.,They don't even know what it is.,They wouldn't even care anyhow.,Nomadic humans always look for,a promised land of some kind.,These children are no different.,Inbuilt human hope and optimism,for a better life ahead,counts for much of the reason,they accept the suffering of life.,These children's promised land was a place,said to have been spared the disaster...,or at least mostly rebuilt...,where the need to hunt them,was no longer necessary,,and where new organized life,was starting again.,Guys!,Hello.,What's wrong with him?,He doesn't speak.,He bit me.,Guys, he's following us.,What's your name?,He bit me.,And now he's crying.,It's because he can't speak...,and he has no parents.,Come on.,He can't say anything.,As the only possible guide,through barren lands and empty towns...,they would follow the remaining train tracks,that would necessarily bring them,to where larger groups of humans lived...,and possible sustenance.,When these tracks disappeared under water,,were burned or ripped out...,they would simply guess their path.,The wearing of clothes in humans had in fact,little to do with shame of nakedness...,which humans don't naturally have...,but rather practicality and comfort.,Vanity sometimes has a part in it.,But with none to speak of,,these children would wear,what was left in abandoned houses...,for comfort's sake.,Chacha, your face!,You too!,Look!,Look!,Look!,We had forgotten what play was.,We locked our children in walls and cities,,we replaced their freedom by thrusting,addictive machines in their hands every Christmas...,which shut them up,and terminated their social abilities.,War and the ravages of it,is not all horror...,but a healthy resetting of human values.,I need water.,I'm going to die.,Lolo, he once saw a bird...,and he really liked it.,Guys, we can't keep stopping like this.,We need to get to Epecu.,How far is it from here?,I don't know.,It took me a few days to get here.,There is no Epecu.,Tata, what are you doing on my head?,I think it's a rat.,He bit me.,I don't like it when animals

the train tracks?,Did you have a dad?,A mum?,What happened to her?,Men.,What happened?,First there was one, then others came...,and mummy was screaming harder every time.,And?,Where is she now?,One of them cut her open here.,She died.,I'm gonna cut them.,What?,Here.,Who?,All men.,We go?,There are people there for sure.,I can't keep it up.,NATIONAL MINISTRY OF EDUCATION,Wait here, I'll go.,Come

buried him.,Stay, please!,I was a teacher in this school.,They all died...,but I stayed here.,Now, there's no one left...,but perhaps...,we could start a new school.,Oh, how lovely that would be.,Would you like that?,Those colored sticks that light up...,I kept them...,for when my students came back.,They're lovely, aren't they?,You like them?,Now I have none left.,My children are also unwell.,But this boy is sick as well.,What happened to him?,I can help you.,I can cure you.,Come with me.,I'll put some cream on this,and tomorrow you'll be better.,Leave him, I'll take care of him.,Come along.,Now you can sleep easy.,I'll take care of him.,You, go to sleep.,You feel pain?,I know it hurts you.,I feel your suffering.,I will help you.,And you will help my children.,Easy

mother.,And...,he must be with...,Mateo...,who couldn't write well.,I helped him a lot.,How I loved my students.,Anyone would have done the same.,I did a kind deed.,I'm a good mother.,Let there be no mistake...,None of our human morals,survive extreme hunger.,None.,We were there.,But now he's dead, and no one thinks of him.,How was it in Epecu when you were there?,I had my parents there.,It's very nice there.,There are swimming pools with games.,And people don't hit or kill children.,When I get there, I'll...,I'll cry...,because I'll have a family.,It's only two or three days,before we get there.,And where will we get food from?,We can't manage three more days.,There isn't even any water around here.,I'm so hungry.,Besides seeking food,,the second-highest priority among them,became the reproduction of the declining species...,from the very moment,nature dictates it to be possible...,and long gone was the ideal about,young adults not being ready to procreate.,A child is no longer one,when it can conceive their own children.,Nature dictates this...,and everything returns to nature.,Any and all of these moral battles that attempt to,distance ourselves from our elemental instincts...,are bound to fail.,Guys, Tati has gone.,What do you mean she's gone?,I don't know.,She left with the baby.,The father needs to go get her.,We can't just leave her.,How will she survive?,If she wanted to go...,Are you going to leave,like Tati and the baby?,No, I'm staying.,Promise?,What now?,Where do we go?,We go straight.,But there are no more tracks.,Only mountains ahead.,We cross them.,It's salty.,I can't go on.,I need water.,Is there much left?,We can't go on.,You're leading us nowhere.,Guys, I think there's a beehive there.,We need to go on.,What's happening?,What happened?,A snake...,There?,No big deal, it was only a small one.,Among thousands of orphaned children,scattered everywhere...,are some who simply had not,had enough contact with their parents,to develop communicative skills.,These are more likely to survive,than those who had been handfed.,Are you hot?,I'll get you some water soon.,Tata!,Tata!,Tata!,What're you doing?,Let it go!,Let it go!,You're hurting it!,I'm leaving!,Guys, look.,They're probably going to Epecu.,They're going to Epecu?,Yes.,Okay, we'll follow them.,But only at night.,In times of genuine famine,,it was the good people who died first.,Those who refused to steal, to sell their bodies,or eat their own species,disappeared first.,Those who refused to kill,would be killed first.,It's no surprise humans ended up like this.,Have you seen Juan?,Who?,Juan...,I'm searching for Juan.,Did he pass by here?,What are you talking about?,He's my brother.,Everyone knows him.,Should we kill him?,Do we kill him?,How'd we cook it?,Just as he is.,He's just hungry.,Juan...,Do we cut him or not?,He stinks.,I have a carrot.,It was for Tata.,Guys, he died.,Are we gonna cut him?,We don't do that.,They do it to us!,I'm so hungry.,I'm gonna cut him.,He stinks of shit!,Since seeing them in their natural state,,I can do nothing else but laugh at,the ideals we held on childhood innocence.,Better every time.,In times of peace and boredom,,we dressed them in cotton white,,gurgle at them,,slap them for any natural deviancy...,and gaze teary-eyed at,our own ideal of innocence.,I'm sick of this!,That's

,As usual before the New Year,we all want to have a forum.,Today I invite you here in order to summarize,1994’s year of community safety and public health affairs,and the situation of stability and unity.,In 1994,the Party Central Committee is headed by President Jiang Zemin. ,In Chengguan District in Lhasa, Tibet Autonomous Region,and under the direct leadership of the Party Committee,our neighborhood, in terms of comprehensive social governance,including stability and unity, community safety, public health,had better results than in 1993,thanks to the cooperation between the temple management committee and the monks.,Last year we were building a new Tibet.,There were no problems in maintaining the reunification of the motherland.,Right now it’s 1996.,Tibetan New Year is coming soon.,During New Year,please continue to adhere to the principles of patriotism and law,and not participate in actions that undermine the unification of the motherland.,If someone comes to the monastery to incite anything,we must stand clearly and stand firm,to continue to uphold the unity of the motherland.,Secretary Wang Dui from the Barkhor office,mainly about the management of outsiders,and items concerning Saga Dawa.,Tomorrow will be the 15th on the Tibetan Calendar,What should be done in social safety and health,Secretary Wang Dui wants to guide us, please pay attention.,The reason for today’s meeting is ,there are four neighborhood committees in our office,The other committees have finished their meeting.,Below we will follow the rules once per month,Have this meeting,The first thing - we comrades invite Chu ,Right now it’s the religious festival Saga Dawa,Tomorrow’s the 15th,Saga Dawa’s prayers and other religious activities,is from the first to the 15th of the Tibetan calendar.,Tomorrow is the last day.,Comrades, we know that there will be a lot of people tomorrow.,Whether it’s Barkhor or Linguo,There are many people near the monasteries and officials from Potala. ,Therefore, we must follow all regulations of the government.,In regards to managing foreigners, ,everyone comes to the city.,This is not a grazing pasture. This is not a deserted place. ,This is a special place so it needs special management.,You must abide by this association’s systems,For example, there will be a lot of people tomorrow,Buddha is fine. Prayer wheels are fine.,Since tomorrow’s the 15th,,no matter which Buddhist activities are held,,due to freedom of religion,,you can all boldly participate.,No one can stop this.,But there’s also things no can do.,Such as fighting - this is not allowed.,Comrades, tomorrow we must pay attention to public security. ,This is the first requirement.,Second, the number of separatists are not few.,Is it called Tibetan Independence? ,Fundamentally speaking, society is stable.,This cannot happen.,But it’s important to prevent it.,This is the main purpose of the meeting tonight.,For those headed to Linguo to turn the prayer wheels, they’ll have to go really early.,The earliest time to leave is 3 or 4 o’ clock.,At this time, take care of your own property,Pay attention to this,Comrades who understand the Tibetan language can go back first.,I’m finished with what I’m saying.,Comrades of Han nationality, please stay here.,Come here, come sit down.,Come a little closer.,Tonight we’re going to have a meeting and post a bulletin.,Announcement,Tomorrow is the traditional Tibetan festival Saga Dawa.,Tomorrow all Tibetans will be devoted to religious activities.,Our Han comrades all have set up stalls.,It was the same when we had a religious holiday last year.,This is also true during the Tibetan calendar.,You do your selling.,This can protect our security personnel.,Am I right? You can safely do your business.,But I hope that you don’t want,If beggars come by, don’t harass them.,You focus on doing your own business.,There are also many people coming from every direction.,It makes no sense to stop them.,Let’s remember the issue of national unity at this time.,We have to bear in mind that our Han comrades have been liberated for longer than Tibetans.,Our enlightenment is also greater than that of the Tibetans so it’s best,to not be disruptive here.,A little thing becomes a big thing.,It’s hard to say by then, right?,These are the things often encountered during riots on Balang Street.,So why are we having a meeting tonight?,It’s for the purpose of safety.,Bajiao Street is safe.,Every day of the past wasn’t filled with riots and trouble.,This is over.,There are three reasons for this ,A party leader,Second, the support and emphasis of the people,Third, the efforts of the workers,In this way, good success has been achieved. These fourteen days,Tomorrow too,From this time to tomorrow,let’s be safe at home.,This is definitely achievable.,But we must be vigilant.,Now the struggle between riots and anti-rioting is long-term.,Complicated.

School of Magical Animals (2021) - full transcript,"The charming live-action adventure with CGI animated animals about an unusual school where the children receive a magical animal as a companion, centers on new girl Ida, who goes from being an outsider to the star student thanks to her magical animal, the talking fox Rabbat. Ida has had to move to another town and is now the ""new girl"" at the Winterstein School. She has a hard time in the new class: bitchy Helene makes sure that Ida has scant chance of making friends, and there is only one place left for her on the first day of school: next to outsider Benni. One day, her teacher introduces the children to Mortimer Morrison, who travels the world looking for ""magical animals"". Each of these animals is destined to become a child's soulmate. Of all people, newcomer Ida and outsider Benni are the first in the class to have magical companions.

Gone (2011) - full transcript,"Kathy Gilleran is a twenty-year veteran police officer from Cortland, New York, a small town that sits in the snow-belt just south of Syracuse. Her son, Aeryn, is a researcher working at the United Nations Industrial Development Organization in Vienna, and a former Mr. Gay Austria. On October 31st, 2007, Kathy receives a call from the U.N. with distressing news: Aeryn failed to show up for work for two days in a row. Kathy immediately flies overseas to find him. Upon arriving in Vienna, she learns that the police have no interest in an investigation. Detectives tell Kathy that Aeryn had been at the Kaiserbründl - an exclusive men's sauna in downtown Vienna - on the evening of October 29th when he suffered an extreme and sudden emotional breakdown, fled the sauna wearing only a towel, ran naked through the city streets, and jumped to his death into the Danube Canal. He was presumed dead and his disappearance written off as a suicide. Yet to Kathy, the police explanation makes no sense, especially because no body had been recovered. Alone, short of funds, yet with abundant resilience, Kathy initiates her own painful quest for the truth. As she persists, she encounters overt police intimidation, abuse, and homophobia. But as Kathy hones her instincts as a mother and her skills as a cop, she finds contradictions in the police statements, an aura of a conspiracy, and ultimately discovers her own strength to keep fighting for her son.","[Voiceover] Let's just start,off with the simple stuff.,What is your name?,My name is Kathy Gilleran.,[Voiceover] So when did,you become a police officer?,I became a police,officer August 19th, 1985.,[Voiceover] And how long,were you a police officer?,And I was a police,officer for 21 years,at the Ithaca police department.,[Voiceover] What do you think,makes a good police officer?,I think what makes a good,police officer is being able,to empathize with the people,that you're dealing with.,
,
,
,
,I think police culture,,for the most part,,has an 'us vs. them' mentality.,And, if you do,that, then you can't,be a good police officer.,I think you have to,be able to somehow,go with the adage of ""There but,by the grace of God goes me"",whether it's the bad,person you're arresting,or the victim of a crime.,It could be you or it could,be someone that you love.,We heard from a very,impressive policewoman,who was hired as a community,neighborhood police officer,and she talked about the,difference that has made,in the lives of the,people of this community.,[Voiceover],Okay, let's move on,
,
,
,
,to talk about,Aeryn a little bit.,When you think about Aeryn,,what are the first words,that come to your mind?,Gone.,I last saw Aeryn,September 20th, 2007.,He had been home for 10 days.,Aeryn was a big boy.,He was about 6'2"", very,muscular, wore a size 13.5 shoe,,and he did all his,shopping at J.C. Penney's.,And so he had to come home,every couple of years,to do his shopping,,and so we ran from one,Penney's store to the other,for the 10 days,that he was here.,And the last time I saw him,was when I took,him to the airport.,He was very happy.,I had two foster kittens,here when he was here,,and he'd never,been a cat person,,and he fell in love with this,one little kitten Woofie.,Woofie (laughs).,This is Woofie, a girl.,There she goes.,His favorite,place in this area,is the plantations at,Cornell, and we ended up,going there three times,while he was here.,And then he spent some,time with my mother,,and we spent time just talking,,watching some movies, and,definitely shopping.,Aeryn loved to shop.,I remember him calling,and I was thinking,about it the other day,'cause I remember laughing,when he called me.,And it had to be,,I think,,1999 maybe.,And I had known he was gay,since he was a teenager.,And it was just, Aeryn,was gay and that was it.,It wasn't anything,we talked about.,He didn't talk about it,so I didn't talk about it,,but I knew he was gay.,So when he called and he says,,""Well, I have something,very important to tell you"",and I said ""What is it?"",and he says ""Well, I'm gay"",and I started laughing.,And he says ""I can't believe,you're laughing at me."",I said ""Well, what other,response would you want?"",I said ""I know you're gay."",He says ""You do?,""Well, who else knows?"",I said ""Well,,grandmother knows."",He says ""She does?"",He said ""Well, damn it, I wanted,to call her and tell her."",I said ""Well, call her."",I said ""Give me five,minutes, I'll call her,""and tell her to act surprised."",(laughing) So I called,her, and she says,""Well, of course Aeryn's gay."",And I said ""Well,,act surprised."",So she did and then he,called me back and hour later,and he says ""Oh, it was great."",He says ""She pretended,she didn't know."",It was just ""Hello, Aeryn."",Aeryn had encouraged,me to put the house,on the market, which I did.,And so one of the,things that we did,when he was home in,September of 2007,was talk about me,coming to live with him,once I sold the house.,He wanted me to come,and stay with him,in Vienna for six months,,and come and experience,what it was like,living in Europe.,So that was the plan.,You know, move to,Vienna, stay with him.,He had things for me to,do, people for me to meet,,and he was gonna keep me busy,,and it was gonna be,quite the experience.,[Voiceover] So these,plans were in the works?,Oh yeah, they were,definitely in the works.,We had plans.,On October 27th, I called,him to let him know,that I had had some,people look at the house,but I still had no offers.,So we talked about me,coming over to Vienna,the first week of December,for seven to ten days.,And we talked about going,to the Christmas market,and to the Kunstfestival,,and he loved that.,So I was looking,forward to that.,(phone ringing),Hi, this is Kathy.,I'm not able to come,to the phone right now.,Please leave a message,after the beep.,Thank you.,On October 31st, 2007,,I was the director,of the Cortland County,SPCA and I was at work.,It was about 1:00 or,1:30 in the afternoon,,and the secretary from the,Ithaca police department,,who I was friends with,,called me and told me,that I needed to go,home, that there was,a phone message waiting for me.,And I said ""What do you mean?"",She says ""Kathy,,you need to go home"",and I could tell by,her tone of voice,that something had happened,,and I kept pressing her,and finally she started,crying and told me,that Aeryn was missing.,And I just jumped up and told,everyone I had to go home,,and drove home very,quickly, and there was,a message on my,answering machine.,[Voiceover] Good afternoon,,my name is Mr. Maseli.,There was a message,from Paul Maseli,,who was the assistant,HR director at UNIDO,,telling me that,Aeryn was missing.,[Voiceover] I would,appreciate if you can call me,as soon as you get this message.,My number is 00431165.,Thank you, bye.,I immediately called,Mr. Maseli in Vienna.,He told me that Aeryn,didn't come to work,,he hadn't been seen,since October 29th,when he left and,signed out at 6:00 pm,,and that Aeryn had never,missed work before,,that he had taken days off and,taken vacation or sick time,but he always called in.,And they knew Tuesday,,when he didn't call in,and didn't show up, that,something was wrong.,And then they were also,alerted by his partner,that he was unable,to get a hold of him.,I then called Pasi and at,they point they knew nothing.,He and Umberto, who was my son's,upstairs neighbor, knew nothing.,They had called around to,various friends of Aeryn,and nobody had seen,or heard from him.,Umberto, the upstairs neighbor,,had Aeryn's apartment key,,so they were able to,go into his apartment.,They saw where he had,a load of wash in,,and the apartment was exactly,the way Pasi had left it,,'cause Pasi had spent,the weekend with Aeryn,and had left the,morning of the 29th,,prior to Aeryn going to work.,They were able to call,around to some people,and they called a friend,of Aeryn's, Georg,,and Georg told them that he,would call people and see.,Georg was able to talk to,someone who had heard secondhand,that Aeryn had been at,the Kaiserbründl sauna,on the evening of October 29th.,And Pasi and Umberto,immediately went to the sauna,and spoke with the manager,,Gunther, and Gunther told them,he did not see what,happened but that,there had been a fight,,that he understood,there was a fight with tourists,and that he had,called the police,,and that the police,didn't respond,,that an ambulance had came.,And he just kept,on saying someone,had to go to the hospital,in the ambulance.,And he told them that,it was at 10:00 at night,and that Aeryn ran,out of the sauna,and they didn't know whether,he was injured or not,but he had been in the,vicinity of the fight.,So prior to me going to,Vienna, I left on November 1st,,the day after I heard,about this information.,I knew that my son was missing,and that something had,happened to him at the sauna.,I do remember the,flight over to Vienna.,It was very surreal.,I remember thinking that,I was going to visit Aeryn,and being very calm considering,,because I kept on,thinking that Aeryn,was gonna meet me,at the airport.,I had only booked the,flight for a week,,because I thought I'll,spend a couple days with him,and find out what happened.,Was he hurt?,And then I'll go home.,And then just make plans,to go back over there,in December for early Christmas.,I didn't want to believe that,something had happened to him.,I just wanted to believe that,everything was gonna be okay.,When I arrived in,Vienna, Pasi met me,and then we took the train in,,and of course I had,lots of suitcases.,When we were approximately,five minutes away,from the apartment,,Umberto called and said,that there were two,investigators at Aeryn's door.,So this is Aeryn's,building here.,And Pasi told him that we,would be there immediately,,you know, don't open the,door until we get there.,Aeryn's apartment,faced Handelskai.,This is the door that,he would walk into.,So when we arrived, the two,investigators and Umberto,were standing outside of,Aeryn's apartment door.,We'll go down to,the fifth floor.,My first impressions,of them were not good.,They wouldn't look at me.,There was no eye,contact whatsoever.,They didn't say anything to me.,They just glanced at me and,then turned toward the door,,and waited for Umberto,to unlock the door.,They walked in and you could see,under his bed from the doorway,,but they walked in and,made a point of getting,on their hands and knees,and looking under the bed.,There was nothing under the,bed, you could see that.,And then they walked,into his living room,and they pulled,out the sofa couch.,And then we were,standing in the doorway.,And then they came,back to the doorway,and they spoke to Umberto,and Umberto asked,me for my passport.,And the one took the passport,and started writing,down information,,and the other one,just stood there,,so I said to him ""Do,you speak English?"",He shrugged and he went ""Ya."",I pulled out my police,retirement badge,and I said ""I am a,retired police officer,""and in America police officers,""take care of police officers."",And he just went...,And that was it.,As a police officer, I was...,I was amazed, I was,shocked, and I was angry,at the fact that,they never greeted me,and that they did,this cursory search.,It was ridiculous.,Into the mail room.,Into the main entry.,To go through that door down,there and turn to the left,,it will take you down,into the basement,where Aeryn kept his bike.,I just had this sinking,feeling that this just...,As bad as I knew it was,,it was gonna get worse.,After Umberto and the,investigators left,,Pasi and I went,immediately to UNIDO,,which is just two train stops,away from my son's apartment.,We met with Mrs. Antonopoulou,,who was the director,of HR for UNIDO,,and Mr. Maseli, and,a few other people.,And they all shared concern,again that Aeryn was missing,,that this was,totally unlike Aeryn,,and Mrs. Antonopoulou said,""Let's call the police.,""Should we call the police?"",And I said ""I think,that's a good idea."",So we went into Mrs.,Antonopoulou's office alone,,just her and I, and she,called the police department,,and she spoke to,Investigator Weiss,,who turned out to,be the investigator,who was at my son's apartment,just two hours or so before that,and who had said ""Ya"" when I,asked him if he spoke English.,She put him on speaker,phone and she asked him,what they think had,happened to my son.,He said that they had,searched the Danube Canal,,which is different,than the Danube River,,because a fisherman,had called them,at 20 after 8:00 on,October 29th and said,that he saw a bald-headed,man float by in the river.,He told her that,at 20 after 8:00,they received the phone,call from the fisherman,and that they immediately,dispatched the scuba team,,the canine unit,,the fire department,,and that the scuba team,went into the water,and searched for my son and,that they dredged the canal,and that the canine,unit searched the area,and the fire department,also did a walking search,,and then at 10 of 9:00,,exactly half an hour,after the phone call,,they cleared the scene.,And she was listening to this,before she started,translating this.,She kept on shaking her,head and writing me notes,,""This doesn't make sense.,""This just doesn't make sense."",She just kept on writing,that over and over again.,So I thought that they,had search the sauna,,around the sauna, so,I said ""Well, ask him,""if they used my son's clothes,to search around the sauna."",And his reply to her is,""Why would they search,""around the sauna?"",He said ""The sauna,doesn't matter.,""It doesn't matter,,it doesn't matter."",He just kept on saying,that over and over again,,'cause she'd write it down,and then she'd,translate it to me.,And so they were totally,disregarding the sauna,,which was like ""Wait a minute,,you know that his belongings,""were at the sauna,,and you're not,""making this,connection anywhere."",I said ""How could they have,done all this in half an hour?"",I mean, it takes,time to suit up,,it takes time to get there.,I told her, I said ""Ask,him about the canine unit,""and what did they have,to search for my son?"",If they didn't,know it was my son,,how did they put the,dog on his scent?,And then he came back and I,remember her rolling her eyes,and she says ""He,said that if you were,""really a police officer,that you'd understand,""how canines work."",And I thought again,that this is not good.,And then the story changed,to ""Well, the fisherman,,""he didn't see a,bald-headed man,,""he saw a body float by,and he called the police."",So within a matter of an hour,this story was starting,to disintegrate.,I was at Aeryn's apartment.,I was asleep November,3rd in the morning,and Pasi and Umberto,woke me up and told me,that Lieutenant Onstein,,who was the security person,who was being a liaison,between the UN and the police,,was on the phone.,As soon as I answered the,phone, he told me that I needed,to get in touch with,the embassy immediately.,And I said ""Why?,What's going on?"",He said ""There's,something wrong.,""The police are,changing their stories."",He said ""There's,something wrong.,""I don't know what,it is, but you need,""to get in touch with,the embassy immediately."",So I said ""Okay."",And so he gave me a,number, so I wrote it down,,and I remember I,got up and I went,to the bathroom and,the phone rang again,and it was Lieutenant,Onstein again,,and he said ""Have,you called them?"",I said ""Well, not yet."",He said ""You need to call them."",He says ""You need to,call them immediately."",He says ""I just had another,call from the police,""and the story has,changed again."",He said ""Something,is terribly wrong."",He said ""They keep,changing the stories"",and he said ""This is not good."",He said ""We need to,do something else."",And he says ""I am,gonna call them."",And he says ""We'll arrange,for somebody from HR,""to go with you to,the police department.,""They'll call you and let know,""what time the,meeting's gonna be."",So, that afternoon,,Sandra, Pasi, and myself,went to meet with the police.,And, initially, there were three,plainclothes investigators,in the office,,and two of them were,smoking and I remember,feeling quite nauseous.,The room wasn't very big,,and I walked over to a window,and I realized that someone was,literally right on top of me,and I turned and one,of the investigators,,who was quite,large, was standing,literally an inch behind me.,And Sandra, who,was bilingual, said,""He doesn't want,you near the window"",and I said ""Well, I'm not,jumping out the window.,""I just need air, the,smoke is bothering me."",She says ""He wants,you to sit down"",and I said ""Tell,him I feel sick."",And so she did and she says he,still wants you to sit down.,So I said ""Okay."",So I went and I sat down and,I put my hands under my legs,,and he stood right,behind me and...,The only thing I could,think of was that,he was trying to intimidate me,,and I don't think,I look dangerous.,I didn't think I looked like,I was gonna cause them harm.,And there was three,of them there,,but it was just,very uncomfortable.,Then I asked for water and,they didn't have any water,,and then I asked to,go to the bathroom,and they didn't have a bathroom,,and finally I just couldn't,hold it in any longer,and I started crying.,[Voiceover] Tell me what,the theory is just based on,the conversation you had with,them that day sitting there.,Their theory is that,he was in the sauna,and that there was some,kind of disturbance,,and he ran out and,committed suicide.,(panting),[Voiceover] Because?,Because he's gay, he's,emotionally unbalanced,,he's HIV positive, and gays,who are all these things,commit spontaneous suicide,all the time in Austria.,And Pasi says ""Well, no.,""He was regularly tested,and he wasn't HIV positive,,""and he received his,results on October 29th,""when he was at work.,""I know he was HIV negative."",And they said ""Well,,how do you know this?"",And he says ""Because,I talk to him."",[Voiceover] And,he ran out at 6:50?,He ran out at 6:50.,[Voiceover] Now,,Pasi is sitting there,telling them this is impossible.,Right, he's telling,them it's impossible.,He's telling them that he was,SMSed at 20 minutes to 8:00,,that Aeryn had,received a phone call,from a friend of his,,Arnisa, at 20 after 7:00,and talked to her for,more than 10 minutes,,so he must've gotten off,the phone with Arnisa,and then SMSed Pasi.,[Voiceover] So the 6:50,thing is just impossible?,It's impossible.,So then the investigator,who was talking to Pasi,then says ""Well,,Aeryn's time thing,""on his phone must be wrong."",So Sandra says in English and,then says it in German to them,""Well, that's impossible,because you don't,""set the time on your phone.,""It's set by the company.,""It's not something you,change, it is what it is."",[Voiceover] I mean,,when you're listening,to this new theory...,I'm thinking ""This,is utter bullcrap."",You know, they throw out that,""Oh, wasn't he Mr. Gay Austria?"",And they asked Pasi ""Did you,know he was Mr. Gay Austria?"",And Sandra turns to,me and she says...,She looks at me and I,remember her closing her eyes,,going like this, just basically,through clenched teeth,she says ""He wants me to ask you,""if you're proud that your,son was Mr. Gay Austria."",And I just sat,there and I thought,""How much more,surreal can this be?"",and I looked at her and I just,looked at the investigator,and I put on probably the,fakest smile I've ever done,and I said ""Extremely.,""Extremely proud."",Everybody loved Aeryn.,I mean, everybody loved Aeryn,,so him being a homosexual,was no big deal,,because he was still Aeryn.,(crowd cheering),[Voiceover] Aaron,Michael John Gillern.,Yay Aeryn!,He actually went to seminary,after Franciscan University,in Vienna, in Graz,,but he was told that,he could be a,celibate gay priest,but he'd have to be willing to,preach against homosexuality,and that's when he,left the seminary,,because he just,couldn't do that.,I'm outraged.,I am still in shock,,because I still...,'Cause I still want to believe,that Aeryn's gonna,walk in the door.,So part of me is saying...,Part of me was thinking ""This,doesn't matter what they say,,""because Aeryn's gonna,walk in the door"",and the other part of me is,""Something happened to my son,,""and I'm never gonna know,,because they don't give a damn.,""They plain and simple,don't give a damn."",The next day, November 4th,,one of the other UNIDO people,,who just wanted to keep me busy,and make sure I was eating,,came and picked me up,and we walked the canal.,If you can go,number than numb...,If you can be more incredulous,than you already are...,I'm just...,I'm tired.,At that point, I thought,if Aeryn's in the canal,,then I should find him, and...,So we walked to the canal for,as far as we could walk it,and I just walked looking,along the edge thinking,that if he was there,that maybe he was,caught on rocks or something.,But there weren't,any fishermen and...,Up further there,was people walking,,there was a walking trail,,but not in that section,because we walked,down to that section,and you could only,walk a certain way.,And there was just beer bottles,and glass and cigarettes,and we even saw a couple,syringes down there,,so it was not a nice area.,And then we had to walk,back up to street level,and walk a ways before,you could walk along,where there was an actual,walking path where people walked.,We walked along the trail here,and got to the point,where we could see,down to the water where it,was shallower on the edges,,and you could see tree,branches and rocks and stuff.,[Voiceover] Do you know,who the fisherman was?,No.,I have no idea who,the fisherman was.,I have never seen the report.,The embassy asked,for the report.,I've asked for the report, and,I have never seen the report.,The state department,asked for the report.,Nobody's ever seen the report.,I've seen it in a,pile across the table.,Vienna is a very,pedestrian-friendly city,and people are constantly,walking around.,Even after the shops are closed,people are walking around.,Doesn't matter what,the temperature is,,people are sitting outside.,It's not unusual to,see people sitting,with the sheep-lined chairs,,sitting outside,having their coffee,,because it's a very,outdoor place to be.,People are just always around.,I never was out there,without people all around me.,And the Kaiserbründl,is located probably,two blocks off the,Kärtnerstrasse, which is one of,the main shopping/tourist areas.,And all these little,side streets have shops,and restaurants and coffee,houses, and churches.,Directly across the street,from the Kaiserbründl,is a church which,has an evening mass,,so there's people,coming to mass.,Kitty-corner to it,is a coffee house.,I was never out there alone.,Never.,I asked the police if,they had any witnesses,and the answer was no.,There was no other witnesses,,just the fisherman.,And the fisherman's story,changed from a bald-headed man,,within a day or two, or it,might've been the same day,,changed to a body floating,to a scream and a splash,to a splash to a scream to,a scream in the distance.,Right now, it is 20 after 7:00.,We're standing in front,of the Kaiserbründl.,I am now gonna make the walk,that supposedly the police...,There's people coming.,On how Aeryn got to the canal.,How they decided this,route I don't know.,This is a restaurant up here.,There's people going in,and out of the restaurant.,People walking dogs.,I'm walking past the,Franciscan church.,Obviously, I'm not running.,They said Aeryn was.,But I'm walking as,briskly as I can.,(panting),As you can see on the,left, this is a restaurant,,all glassed in, people,sitting at a window.,This is the cross street,that even if Aeryn,had come down from the,Kaiserbründl one block up,leading in the,direction I'm facing,,he would have had to,cross this busy street.,Here is a large hotel, trams,,traffic, pedestrians.,If you look this way, it's,the Schwedenplatz down there.,And if you look this way,,the building that's lit up,is the (speaks in,foreign language).,So in going with the police map,,Aeryn would've crossed here,and would have ran,into an iron gate,,not the steps.,(panting),The jump from here down to there,I would think would,be pretty maiming.,On November 6th, I got a,call from Lieutenant Onstein,saying that I should,meet him at the UN,,that we were gonna go,to the police department,and pick up Aeryn's belongings.,So I went to UNIDO and met,with him and he was very quiet,,and we went to the,police department,,the same police department.,And Investigator Weiss was there,and there was another,investigator there,,the one who had been,typing up the report,when he was talking to Pasi.,He sat over in the,corner and he just,sat there with his head down.,And Investigator Weiss just,stood there and he had this,huge plastic garbage,bag on the floor,and he pointed at it,and he said something to,Lieutenant Onstein and Onstein said,""That's your son's stuff.,""It's your son's belongings."",And so I sat down on the,floor and I opened the bag,and I could smell Aeryn.,And I took his t-shirt out,and I just kept smelling it,and I couldn't stop crying,,and I asked for kleenex,and Onstein asked Investigator,Weiss and he said no.,And I told them I,was gonna get sick,,and Lieutenant Onstein told him,and he just shrugged,his shoulders.,I said ""You gotta let me,use the bathroom, please,,""so I can get sick."",And Lieutenant Onstein,raised his voice,and finally the investigator,who had been sitting,over to the side got,up and went like this,and Onstein told me to follow,him and I went to the bathroom,and I just kept getting sick,and Onstein said ""Let's go."",And so I picked up this huge bag,that was all that was left,of my son, and out we went.,Nobody said anything to us.,And we're walking down the,street and Onstein told me,,he says ""I can't,help you anymore"",and I just looked at,him, I said ""What?"",He says ""You know, I'm,busy, I've got a lot,""of stuff at work,,I've got stuff going on,""in my own personal life and,I can't help you anymore."",So I just got on the train,and had this huge bag,,and it wasn't until,later that night,that I had the,strength to open it,and really look through it.,In his bag, when I started,going through his bag,,there was the printed lab report,saying he was HIV negative.,And there was his phone,,and when I saw the phone,I called Umberto,who lived upstairs,,'cause I didn't want to,touch it and break it,and do something that,would erase something.,And he came downstairs,and he turned the phone on,and there were the phone calls.,And they were there and the,correct time was on the phone,,and the correct time,was on the phone calls.,[Voiceover] At that,point, when you see,the HIV report, you know.,I know they're lying.,They're just...,They just don't care.,He's just a gay man.,He's not Austrian, and,they just don't care.,They just don't care.,They just don't care, or,they're covering something up.,Once I saw the phone,and the lab report,saying he was negative,,I'm sickened, I'm angry,,and I'm scared because I don't,know where to go with it.,I can't trust the police.,I've already met,with the embassy,and I know the embassy's not,gonna do a damn thing for me.,This is the consulate office.,This is where I had to sit,with other people at a table,,strangers filling out,forms for passports,,and talk about my,missing gay son,,to the Consulate General,I believe her title is,,Constance Anderson.,This is where she said,she'd pray for my son.,She grabbed her crucifix and,I told her that he was gay.,I have the security,liaison person,doesn't want to be,involved anymore.,My son used to work here?,[Voiceover] Yes.,Please delete what,you're taping right now.,It's for security reasons.,I call police.,It's not allowed.,UNIDO doesn't want,to ruffle the feathers,because they're a,guest in Austria.,So although they'll send,translators with me,,they don't want to,do anything else,,and I'm at a loss.,I knew that I really,had to pull it together,as much as I possibly could,and find out the truth,,because the police weren't,gonna help me find the truth.,I mean, he was my,son and if it took me,for the rest of my life,,I was gonna find out.,So I just contacted people,back here in the States,and I had one friend who's,still with the police department,get in touch with an FBI,agent who got in touch,with an FBI agent with the,chargé d'affaires at the embassy,,but the only thing that,they do are extraditions.,They don't do investigations,,so they couldn't help.,And I just lucked into,talking to a person,who knew a person who knew a,gay bookstore owner in Vienna.,So I thought ""Well, I,gotta start somewhere."",I had no idea where,it was gonna lead,,and I ended up going,to this gay bookstore.,This is the university section,and I'm walking down the street.,Where the potted plant is and,the windows, that's Cafe Berg.,And then around the corner,,where the rainbow flags,are, is the bookstore.,I remember walking,into the gay bookstore,and straight ahead of the,door was a table with a book,and I looked at it,and I started crying,because it was a,book that Aeryn had.,And these two men were,behind the counter,and they were like,""Whoa, what is this?"",And one came up to me and I,said ""I'm looking for Viet"",and he said ""Viet?"",I said ""Viet"" and,he says ""That's me."",And I told him, I said ""I'm,Aeryn Gillern's mother."",And he looked at me,,he says ""I know Aeryn."",And this was, again, all before,it had been in the press.,This is where he took,me in and we sat down.,So he took me into the back,and I just blurted,out everything,and he just sat there,overwhelmed with all this,and he said ""Well, let me,make some phone calls."",And he says ""I'm,gonna call somebody."",He said two weeks ago,,well, two weeks prior to,Aeryn's disappearance,,so around the middle of October,,the police in Vienna,started a gay and lesbian,support group for gay and,lesbian police officers,to support them because,of discrimination,within the police department,and also to train them,to be liaisons with,the gay community,,because the gay and,lesbian community,was so mistrustful of,the police department.,So he said ""I know the,person who's pretty much,""in charge of this, and,he's a gay police officer,""and I'm gonna call him."",So he called him and Ewald said,he would come and,meet me that night.,Ewald talked with me,for about an hour.,I gave him all the,information that I had had.,I told him about,the two meetings,that I had had with the police,,the one on the 3rd and,the one on the 6th,,how upset I was,at the treatment.,And so Ewald went into the,bookstore side of this place,and called a friend of his,who worked at the call center,,which I assume is like a 911.,His friend at the,call center told him,that there had been no,calls in the first district,on the 29th of October, 2007,,and the Urania, the area,where the fishermen were,,are in the first district,,that the scuba divers,were never sent out,,that the canine unit,was never dispatched,,and the fire department,was not dispatched,,and that no calls came in,from the sauna,that night either.,This is the cross street,that even if Aeryn,had come down from the,Kaiserbründl one block up,leading in the,direction I'm facing...,It just...,You know, my mind,was going in so many,different directions as it was,because I was,constantly vacillating,between anger and sadness,and just this emptiness and,this shock feeling of dullness,where there was,nothing affecting me,and just this range of emotions,,and then to see,this it was like...,I'd already felt,uncomfortable with the police,,I already mistrusted the police,,and now it just confirmed it.,I just want answers.,I want the truth, I want,justice, I want my son.,Most of all, I just want my son.,I know everybody,tells me to hope and,it's a very scary,thing to hang on to.,On November 13th, we had,a meeting with the police,and Ewald had arranged,it through someone,,he didn't tell me who, but,somebody high up in the ranks.,He said ""I've gotten,a hold of somebody,""who's very interested in,this and this is a person,""who helped start the gay,and lesbian support group,,""and they will have,someone at that meeting,,""and you'll be okay."",I said ""Alright."",So myself and Angelica Radix,,who was the,psychologist at UNIDO,,went to again the same,building, the same room,where I was given,my son's belongings.,We went in up these stairs.,We started off the meeting,with Angelica saying,to the investigator,that sat to my right,""We would like it,very much if you would,""only talk for a minute,or two, and then give me,""time to translate,,and then talk again,,""so that Aeryn's mother can,understand what's going on,""and if she has any,questions, she can ask."",And he looked at her and,he just shook his head,and he said ""No"" and he said,something to her in German,and I could see her,shoulders slumping.,She looked at me, she says ""No,,he will conduct the meeting,""the way he wants to."",So this investigator,just started talking,,just nonstop talking, and,I kept on saying to her,""What's he saying?"",She says ""Hold on, hold on."",I said ""What's he saying?"",And I was getting frustrated,,and finally I said,""This is unacceptable,,this is unacceptable."",And at that point,,this was probably,10 minutes into this meeting,,Lieutenant Haimeder stands up,,he said ""You're unacceptable,,""your behavior is unacceptable."",He says ""You are rude"" and,I said ""I'm unacceptable?"",And I started crying, I said,""I am not unacceptable."",I said ""I don't know what's,going on, what's being said."",I said ""You speak English,and you're letting this man,""speak in German and,not let her translate,,""and you obviously,now speak English."",But I told him, I said,""You are unacceptable."",I said ""This is wrong and,you know this is wrong"",and he rolled his eyes.,He said ""Well then,you don't understand.,""You don't understand how,an investigation works,,""and you don't understand things,like spontaneous suicide."",I said ""I do understand,,and I understand,""from talking to a,psychiatrist that there's,""no such thing as,spontaneous suicide."",And he comes over and,he grabs the chair,and he sits right down next,to me, he puts his hands,on my knees, and I went like,this and I pushed them off.,I said ""Don't touch,me, do not touch me."",So he leaned forward and,he said to me, he said,""You used to be,a police officer"",and I sat there, I,said ""Yes"" and he said,""What were you, a,parking meter maid?"",And he went like,that and I said ""No,,""I was a police officer,,""I was a neighborhood,police officer."",(yelling),(gunshots),So, very cocky, he says ""So,,do you have anymore concerns?"",I said ""Excuse me?"",I just didn't like the tone.,He said ""Do you have,anymore concerns,""you'd like to address with us?,""Seems like you have a lot,of problems with the police."",I said ""I have a,lot of questions,""and I have a lot of,concerns, but I don't think,""you're the one that I'm,gonna go to with them."",And he says ""Oh, you'll,run to somebody else,""and have them go,above our heads?"",Then he had written,down notes, and he said,""You need to sign this"",and it was in German,,and I said ""I'm not signing,it, I'm not signing anything."",He says ""You have to sign,it"" and Angelica Radix,,the psychologist translator,,said ""You need to sign it."",I said ""I'm not signing,anything that I can't read."",And she says ""Well,,but I'm the translator"",and I said ""I'm not signing it."",I said ""Because he was writing,down things that aren't true,""and I'm not signing,it, there's no way,""I'm signing anything."",And then he got distracted,and we just walked out.,[Voiceover] All,this time there's been,no press coverage of Aeryn.,Absolutely not.,I raised the question,with Lieutenant Haimeder,about why there was,no press coverage,and he said that he didn't,feel it was necessary.,And I told him, I said,""Well, how do you know,""that people didn't,see something,,""that someone might,not come forward?,""Why wouldn't you put,this in the press?"",So they did and on,the 20th it came out,and the headlines,were startling.,""Naked UN Diplomat Runs,Naked Through the Streets."",""Mr. Gay Austria,"",gay this, gay that.,""Spontaneous Suicide."",And I know it's not,fair to stereotype,an entire country,or group of people,but all I could think of was,60 years ago, 64 years ago.,This is Judenplatz.,You know, they were,doing the same thing.,This is the memorial for,all the Austrian Jews,that were killed,during World War II.,When they gave up the,Jewish population,,when they gave up,their homosexuals,,when they gave up the,Jehovah's Witnesses,,when they gave up people who,were insane, as they termed it.,And it struck me that,that caricature that they,had painted along,with much of Europe,was the same caricature,that they were,using to paint my son.,And they made him small.,They just minimized,him, and just put,all these labels,on him, so that he,wasn't a real person anymore.,And they won't speak to me.,And they're turning,my son into this,,this creature, not even,a person, to be mocked,,and then just to be,""Yep, he's gone."",Every morning someone,from UNIDO would call me,and get me up in,the morning and...,The view from the UN,to Aeryn's apartment.,I'd get up and I'd go over,and have some breakfast,and I'd go over to,UNIDO, at the UN,,and I'd have lunch,in the commissary,because they had American food,and I could bring home real,milk instead of Austrian milk.,And I'd check my email and,I'd talk to Angelica Radix,,the crisis psychologist, and...,And then I'd go home for awhile,,back to Aeryn's apartment.,It's Aeryn's mailbox, 204-37.,And...,I couldn't watch,TV because I didn't,know what they were saying.,And then I'd get,dressed real warm,and I'd generally,leave about 5:00,,and I'd take the U-Bahn,to the last stop,,and I'd walk all the way back.,And this is Schwedenplatz.,And then I'd stand in,front of the Kaiserbründl,for about an hour or so and...,If I got going earlier,,I'd go to the churches too,,if they were still open.,Sometimes they,stayed open later.,I had a routine.,On I think it was,December 4th or 5th,,I went there and I,was standing outside,as normal, as I did every,night, with a picture of Aeryn,,and this young man came out,and he spoke in halting English,but he says ""Oh Aeryn, Aeryn.,""Are you Aeryn's mother?"",And I said ""Yes."",And he said ""Oh I knew,Aeryn, I knew Aeryn."",He says ""Come on,in, come on in."",I said ""Come in?"",He says ""Yeah, come on in."",I said ""I can't come in."",He says ""Oh you can come in."",He had a woman by the,name of Evelyn with him,,who was either American or,Canadian, and she translated,,'cause Jens only spoke,German, or so he said he did.,And he took me on the tour.,I shocked everybody,by walking in,,and the men standing,at the counter,to check in to get their,towels and slippers,,I mean, they were standing,there with their Homburg hats,and their very,well-tailored clothing.,And immediately newspapers,came up in front of their face,probably thinking I,was somebody's wife.,And actually I wanted to see it,'cause I wanted,to see the layout.,I wanted to see if there,were video cameras.,I wanted to see what,the place looked like.,And he kept on,stopping and crying,,and at one point I reached,out to touch his shoulder,because I was trying,to act very poised,and like I just wanted to see,the architecture and stuff,,and she said ""Don't touch,him, don't touch him."",And I was like ""Okay, okay."",She says ""You just,have to let him be."",She said ""This is,very hard for him."",And I'm just keeping things,inside thinking ""Hard for him?"",And then we got to this one,room with murals on the wall,,and he stood there and he,just kind of went like this,and he started crying and,he went down on the floor,and he just started,doing this on the tiles.,And inside I was freaking,out because I thought,""What is going on?"",But I didn't want them to think,that I was there trying,to get information,because then I knew,they'd get rid of me,,so I was like ""What's going on?,""Should we..."",She says ""No, this is the,last place that he saw Aeryn."",[Voiceover] So he's,like down on the floor.,He's down on the floor, and,he's literally on the floor,and he's rubbing the tiles,,and then he gets himself up,and he's crying and he's just,holding himself like this.,And we went through,a few other rooms,and then we went back upstairs.,And I asked her, I said ""Ask,him what happened to my son."",And she just said to me, ""He,doesn't want to talk about it."",She says ""You need,to know,"" she said,""that your son is gone."",And she said ""It doesn't,matter what happened here.,""Your son is gone."",And I just looked at her,,I said ""But it does matter.,""I need to know what,happened to my son."",She says ""It doesn't matter,what happened to him here.,""Your son is gone."",Then she told me that,he had a present for me,and he gave me two polo tops,that had Kaiserbründl on it.,And at that point,,I was ushered out.,That was it.,[Voiceover] When,you were on your tour,,did you see any,video cameras there?,[Kathy] Yes I did.,[Voiceover] How many, like,,where were there video cameras?,There was video,cameras at the entrance,,there was video,cameras downstairs,,and in one of the hallways,there was a video camera.,[Voiceover] Do you,know if the police,ever looked at the tapes?,I don't know that.,I don't know that the,police ever looked,at anything or,interviewed anybody.,[Voiceover] So do you think,they know what happened?,Yes, I do believe that,they know what happened.,I wanted to stay,at his apartment.,I just wanted to live,there and wait for him.,I couldn't pay the mortgage,and I couldn't pay the rent,at the same time over there.,The rent was coming due,and I couldn't get a job,because I wasn't an,Austrian citizen.,The only place I could,work was at the UN,and they didn't,have a job for me,and I wasn't in any,condition to work.,It was terrible.,It was really bad.,I think the worst,part, even moreso,than getting on the airplane,,was packing up Aeryn's things,and giving his things away.,Shipping home what,I could ship home.,I shipped home all his movies.,He had like a couple,hundred movies.,He loved movies.,And CDs, he loved music.,And I couldn't leave,any of that stuff there,and I couldn't give,any of that stuff away.,But he had a home.,It wasn't just his,apartment, he had a home.,He had pots and pans and linens.,He loved to cook.,You know, all kinds of cookware.,I've probably got three,knives and three forks,and three spoons and,a couple glasses,,and he had a home.,He had decorations,and he had books,and he had chachkies,all over the place,and he had pictures on the wall.,I packed all the pictures and,I packed what I could but...,He had toasters, he had mixers,,he had all these baking things,,he had a washing machine,,he had this table,that he had picked,out, he had a sofa bed,,he had his bed, you,know, all his furniture,,all these things that,were important to him.,I was just leaving,him and I was just,getting rid of all his stuff,,and that hurt the most,,because it's all I had left.,It was just his,material possessions.,[Aeryn] These are mine.,My stuff goes in,my coats and stuff.,Again, there's pictures there.,I always keep,pictures of people.,And there's pictures,on the wall there.,Let's see, there's,Rahman and you're there.,And there's other,pictures, with grandmother,and great grandfather, and,there's your dad and you,and Rahman there.,Okay, and this is when you,come into the house here.,I'm at the front door.,There it is, okay.,And there is the,door to the room.,And this farther up in the,corner, this is my closet.,This is your room when,you come to visit, momma.,Aeryn had a great soaking tub.,It was real deep and big and,I'd run the water real hot,and I'd close the,door and I'd...,Then I'd shove a wash cloth in,my mouth and I'd just scream,,and I'd cry, and I'd cry,,and I'd cry, and I'd cry.,So that's it for me.,I love you.,I hope you guys are doing well.,Come visit one day,when you can.,And I hope you guys,do watch the video,I'm gonna support the,support the hell out of you.,Loves, kisses, and,talk to you later.,Bye.,I just wanted to wait for him.,And I felt like I was,abandoning him by coming home.,I didn't have a choice.,I had to come home.,So when I came home,,it's like I didn't know,what I was gonna do.,I wanted to go,right back to work.,I had to stay busy,,'cause otherwise I was,afraid I was gonna go nuts.,I was just gonna live with it.,I was just gonna,go to counseling.,And I didn't know,what to do with it.,I just dove right,back into work.,I literally just,dove back into work.,I'd work 10, 12 hours a,day, because I thought,if I'd exhaust myself,,and just keep busy,with everything,else, get involved,with all the drama at,work, with the employees,,with the animals, that I,wouldn't have to deal with it.,I was just this,automaton that was,going to work everyday,,trying to exhaust herself,,and then coming home,every night and crying,,and crying, and crying, and,literally howling like a wolf,with so much pain and emptiness.,You know, I tried reading.,Reading was real hard and,I always love reading,,but if I read 10 pages and,then put the book down,,the next night I'd have,to read 9 to be able,to figure out what I had,read the night before,,so I never got,very far very fast.,All my friends kept on saying,""You gotta talk to someone.,""Talk to this newspaper,,talk to that, call this.,""We're gonna call this"",and I'm like ""Nope."",Because I didn't,trust the media.,I was afraid that they,were gonna hurt him,,and he'd already been,hurt and minimized,and I couldn't let,anybody else hurt him.,I had to protect,him, and if it meant,keeping it out of the,media, then I was gonna,keep it out of the media.,And then in June, the,board changed at the SPCA,,and in July, they were gonna,fire me, plain and simple.,I didn't fit into their clique,,and so I resigned,and I spent two weeks,really weepy and,depressed and everything,because it was like ""Oh my,God, I have no structure now.,""I have nothing."",All I have is this loop,going around in my head.,I had a rule, and my counselor,hates that I had this rule,,but it was like ""I,don't cry before 4:00.,""Look credible, look,sure of yourself,,""look strong, whatever."",And I tried to keep,that rule in effect,for those seven months that,I was in sheer avoidance.,And then there wasn't anything,to hide behind anymore,when I didn't have the,job at the shelter.,There was no more walls,for me to hide behind,,and then I realized that this,isn't just gonna go away.,I started making phone calls,and letting people know.,And my friends were,very helpful and knew,that this was what,I needed to do,,knew that this was the,healthiest thing for me to do.,A miraculous,medal, a race number,,a bear sewed in eighth,grade, and a video.,Mementos of a son Kathy Gilleran,hasn't heard from since October.,After several attempts to,contact the Austrian police,,Kathy Gilleran finally got,a one-page response in May,stating that her son,was reported missing,along with his case number.,She says the U.S. State,Department is unable,to force another government,to further investigate.,So right now, she's just,praying for a miracle.,Kathy Gileran will be in,Austria on October 29th,,the one-year anniversary,of her son's disappearance,,and she plans on making,this trip every single year,until she brings him home.,[Voiceover] Why did,you return to Vienna?,'Cause I missed Aeryn.,Because I felt Aeryn and,because Aeryn's in Vienna.,It amazes me sometimes how,some place so beautiful,can bring back so much pain.,I believe that's the Danube.,And there is Vienna,,Vienna airport.,[Voiceover] Tell me about,the vigil that you had.,The vigil was just a very,subdued one, just very quiet.,I had it directly,across the street,from the Kaiserbründl,sauna, which is probably,only like maybe 20 feet.,It was just literally across,a one-lane street, that's it.,But the sauna didn't want me,to interfere with,their business.,They wanted me to,take my sadness,and affection somewhere else,,so I took it across the street,in the side doorway of,the Franciscan church.,And the Franciscan,church was the first time,I went to visit Aeryn,was the first church,that he took me to.,There was a couple churches,that he really liked.,When we came here that,night, November 1st,,the first night that I was here,,we actually looked behind,everything that we could,thinking that maybe,he was passed out.,Several people that were,going into the sauna,or coming out of,the sauna came over,because we had his picture.,And they came over and they,talked, most in English.,""Oh, we remember Aeryn.,""We had great,discussions with Aeryn."",A lot of other people,have stopped and said,that they were praying,,that they would pray.,And one man walked,by and read it,,asked some questions and said,""I will inquire about this."",It was just very nice,that people stopped by.,But one of the strange,things that happened,,and it didn't hit me till,,I don't think it hit me,till I got home, was,we were standing there,is that all of a sudden,there was a priest,standing in front of me.,And I looked and I,said ""I hope it's okay,""that we're standing here."",And he said ""Oh no, sure,,sure, it is, it is."",And again, it didn't,hit me till I came home.,He was Irish.,And how bizarre was that?,Here was this Irish,priest in Vienna.,And he says ""I'm praying for,him, I'm praying for Aeryn."",It was just very,odd because he had,just walked up and,he looked at me.,He didn't look at the signs.,He just walked up and looked,at me and he said Aeryn's name.,In my mind, I like to,imagine that Aeryn sent him.,And he knew I'd get a kick,out of an Irish priest.,So I think that was...,It was just something,special that he did for me.,What I did learn,after I came back...,I had met with a reporter,,Joseph Gepp from the Falter,,and he did two articles,for the newspaper,,and in it he says that,there were no witnesses,,because this is what the,police have always said,,that there was no witnesses,except for the fisherman.,And the next day,,he had an email,from a university student,that said he saw Aeryn,,that he and his,girlfriend saw Aeryn.,And Joseph wrote to me,,he says ""I'm not sure,""whether to believe,them or not."",This the U-Bahn station,and the students,were standing,somewhere around here,and saw Aeryn running,up these steps.,(panting),Initially, when Joseph,emailed me and told me,that people had,seen my son running,,my whole belief,system fell apart,,because then I was like,""Hey, have I been in denial?,""Did he jump up from,the sauna and just run,""and jump into the canal?"",And Joseph called them,and then he met with them.,And they were out walking,,they saw Aeryn run,near the Kaiserbründl,,naked, covering his privates.,And they said that,they thought that maybe,it was a college,prank or something.,So the girl did,the wolf whistle,,and that Aeryn stopped and,turned and looked at them.,According to the witnesses,,this is approximately,where they saw Aeryn,,and they were over there.,And the way they,described it to Joseph,is that they've,never seen anyone,look so scared in their life.,(panting),I wrote him, I wrote,him plain and simple.,I said ""So he committed,spontaneous suicide?"",And he wrote back, he,says ""Nobody says that,,""except for the police."",He says ""Don't go there."",He said ""Something happened.,""Something happened to your son.,""Something happened at,the sauna, and after that,""we're gonna have to figure,out what happened then."",And he says ""But,irregardless, if your son,""ended up in the canal,,it wasn't his choice."",What's interesting,is when Joseph,presented this,information to the police,,the police said ""No, there,weren't any witnesses.,""These people are lying."",So these people said that,they didn't call the police.,But on the 20th when they,saw it in the newspaper,,the next day they,called the police,,that the police sent,over two investigators,and that they gave a statement.,And the police say,""No, they're lying."",So these people are either,credible enough or stupid enough,,the gentleman was,anyway, to give his name,and allow Joseph,to do another story,including the man's name,,saying what the man saw,and the man saying ""I,don't know why the police,""would say that,nobody came forward."",And like Joseph said,,he says ""I believe him."",And he said ""And he's,willing to give his name,""and willing to speak,out against the police."",And that's huge there,,that is absolutely huge.,Why lie about a witness?,Why would you lie about someone,coming forward and,saying they saw him?,If they had told,me that back then,,I would've went like this.,I would've stopped and said,""Geez, what are we missing?,""What are we missing?,""Let's concentrate,on the goddamn sauna,""and find out what happened,there,"" etc., etc., etc.,I think this was,entertainment for them.,They weren't afraid to,change a story like that,in front of other people.,They weren't afraid,of telling things,that couldn't possibly be,true, in front of other people.,They weren't afraid of,showing, like the SMS thing,,and saying in front of other,people and reconstructing it.,They weren't afraid,of doing any of this.,And that's what's so scary.,I know from being,a police officer,that it's a whole lot easier,to show up at a crime scene,,see a dead body, and,go ""Yup, suicide."",So, you know, I'm communicating,with friends back home,and they're saying ""Hire,a private investigator.,""Hire an attorney."",UNIDO sets me up with,a freebie session,with an attorney,who speaks English.,Well, kind of.,And he tells me, he,says ""Well, you know,,""put your police hat,on and think about it."",He says ""You've got a gay sauna,""in the fanciest,district of Vienna.,""How do you think it,existed this long?"",He says ""Don't you,think there's somebody,""connected to the,sauna in government,""or the police,department or whatever?"",And I'm thinking ""Yeah."",He says ""You'll never,find the truth."",I've talked to several police,and they all say the,case was botched.,There are so many things wrong,but they cannot talk about,it for fear of their life.,That to me means something,big, but what that is,and whether I'll ever,find out, I don't know.,And that's what scares me,,that I will have to,live with not knowing.,I mean, knowing is still gonna,be difficult to live with,'cause I still won't have Aeryn,,but not knowing is just,this perpetual limbo.,I met with the Green Party,when I was in Austria.,Thankfully, Aeryn had a,very good friend Florian,,who came to the vigil,,and Florian has,friends in high places.,So Florian arranged an,interview meeting with me,and two members of parliament,,one that deals primarily,with police issues,and one that deals specifically,with gay and lesbian,issues in the police.,And I met with them,,sent them all the,information that I had.,They spoke to several,people and they have filed,an official inquest,and it's been accepted,by the Minister of the,Interior, Maria Fekter.,[Voiceover] So when you heard,there was going,to be an inquest,,what did you immediately think?,I was excited.,I was excited that,the Green Party,was even interested,in doing anything,,that they were outraged at the,things that I had told them,,the way the police had acted.,So I thought this was gonna,be a really good thing.,I was very excited about it.,My hopes were that the,truth was gonna come out,,that the police were gonna,have to admit that they lied,,admit that they had fabricated,,that they had,manipulated information,,and that they had,treated the case badly,,that they had defamed my son,,that they had treated me bad,,and in Aeryn's absence they,had treated him deplorably.,An inquest is, from what I,understood from the Green Party,,is supposed to be,an external review,of what the police,department did or didn't do.,What happened was,it was turned over,to the police department,to review themselves.,In the inquest, the police,say that they did not respond,,that the fire department,did, and that the head,of the fire department,unit that responded,decided that the water,current was going too strong,to put divers in the,water, so the divers didn't,get dispatched to the scene,,and that they cleared.,They didn't dredge, they,didn't go in the water,,they didn't put boats out, he,didn't ask for a canine unit,,they didn't do anything.,It totally absolved the police,of any involvement whatsoever.,I walked around.,I mean, it was early in the day,and I ended up just,walking around.,And I didn't have anything,planned for the rest of the day.,I didn't feel defeated.,I can't say I was,any more depressed,than I was over any other,news from the police,,because it wasn't unexpected.,Aeryn loved Vienna.,Everything about it.,The people got dressed up.,That was a big thing.,Vienna was his,literal cup of tea,,because he could get dressed up,and he could walk around,and feel proud of himself.,He loved the culture, he,loved the architecture,,he loved everything about it.,Just the fact that it was,old, that it had tradition.,We went around and he showed me,all the buildings that he loved.,[Aeryn] The church off in,the distance called the...,That's a good church, I,was there for a while.,There is the turm,,the Donauturm.,(mumbles),And that was the tallest building,in Europe for a long time.,[Kathy] He loved the,history of it, the Habsburgs,,the Kaiser, and,Sisi and all that.,[Aeryn] That's an old statue,of old Kaiser, Franz Joseph.,This is part of the old palace.,It's called the Hofburg.,We went to the,Habsburg palace,,and just everything,,he just loved it,and I appreciated it.,I do feel that I'm trying,to prove that I'm right,,and they're helping,,whether they know it or not.,You know, a wall,will get knocked down,or maybe even just a brick,gets loose in the wall.,But they do it themselves.,You know, a little tap on the,wall and something will fall,and something else,will come into place,that will substantiate,what I knew,the first or second week,after Aeryn disappeared,,what I knew, what I felt.,And then they come forward,and go ""Oh, yes this.,""Well, yes this.,""Well, no this."",And it's like ""Gee,,well, that's what,""I've been saying all along."",I guess my hope is that,I keep it going.,I'll just keep on,knocking more bricks out.,And my ultimate hope,is that somebody,develops a conscience at,some point and comes forward.,A police officer,can't look at himself,in the mirror anymore, and,says ""I know what happened."",[Voiceover] A mother,here in central New York,is searching for her son.,He disappeared three years ago.,Caitlin Nuclo reports.,[Voiceover] Kathy,Gilleran is packing her bags,and setting off on,a search to find out,what happened to her son.,I once was told that justice,delayed was justice denied,,so at this point I don't know,if there's gonna be any justice.,All I can fight for is the truth,and hopefully being able,to bring Aeryn home.,(""Gone"" by Jenn Morson),♪ Last time you were here,♪ If I had

Zoya (2020) - full transcript,"Autumn 1941. Yesterday's schoolgirl Zoya Kosmodemyanskaya volunteered for a sabotage school. The partisan detachment, in which Zoya was located, is ambushed, and Zoya is captured by the Germans, while trying to set fire to the barn. Interrogations and torture have led nowhere. She did not say anything that could disrupt the assignment of other groups. The Nazis could not even achieve her real name - Her sacrifice was not in vain. Her feat inflamed millions of hearts, helping our soldiers to reach Berlin.","GORKY FILM STUDIO,TRIIKS MEDIA,THE MINISTRY OF CULTURE,OF THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION,THE RUSSIAN MILITARY HISTORY SOCIETY,- Hello, Mrs. Kosmodemyanskaya!,- Hello!,MOSCOW, SECONDARY SCHOOL No. 201,21 JUNE 1941,- Hello, Mrs Kosmodemyanskaya!,- Hello!,Did you know, Kiselyov from 9B,promised to invite me.,- Hello, Mrs. Kosmodemyanskaya!,- Hi, Lena!,- Have you seen Zoya?,- Upstairs, go on up!,- Thank you.
