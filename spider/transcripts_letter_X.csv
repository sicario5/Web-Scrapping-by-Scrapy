X - The eXploited (2018) - full transcript,"Would you believe in a policewoman who suffers from such serious panic disorders that she is afraid to get close to any crime scene and has been on permanent office duty for more than a decade? Would you believe a lone mother who is unfit to pay her mortgage and also raise her rebellious teenage daughter? Indeed, no one believes that the troubled ex-detective has discovered a serial murder case. Personal dramas and a murder mystery unfold in present-day Budapest, where demonstrations are part of the pre-election life of a city still trying to cope with the shadows of its historical and recent past. It is a city where nothing seems honest and true, except through the eyes of an emotionally unstable policewoman and her misfit daughter who wants to know who her father truly was.","BUDAPEST POLICE HEADQUARTERS,2 million people live in this city.,4 people per day commit suicide,or die under unclear,circumstances or in accidents.,We investigate these unusual deaths,with administrative procedures.,Only 2 percent are proven to be,the result of foul play.,But last week, 3 such cases occurred,,which extends way beyond,the statistical margin of error.,2 of these are my cases,,and one case has already been,closed by our colleagues.,Here, the victim didn't pull the handbrake,,

set us up.,Uh-huh.,And why did you search every drawer in the guest bathroom,last weekend after your performance?,What were you looking for?,You're a f###ing psycho.,You're a parody of yourself, you know that?,I was on the rag.,I was bleeding through my g-string.,I was looking for a tampon.,You have 10 different types of condoms in there.,CHRISTIAN: [chuckles],Every lotion known to man, but no

her?,CHRISTIAN: Why did you go to her room?,It's not even in the main house.,I was looking for you.,How'd you hurt your arm?,Well, I got upset.,There was more to that footage.,Things that got cut out.,That night I was watching all of you live and I saw something.,Something really, really, bad.,Happen to someone who I thought was you.,STELLA: Because he had my mask.,What happened to him?,Jackson happened to him.,JACKSON: I was extremely drunk and let's just,say I was never fully consenting.,Oh my god.,We have to tell him.,He has blocked my number.,Let's go over there and tell him

anyway.,CHRISTIAN: You don't understand.,If I tell him I will look like an absolute monster.,Making up atrocities just to get him to talk to me again.,I can allow him to believe that I'm,a pervert, a psycho, a b###h, but not that I would concoct,a rape just because I am sad.,The day that you came to see me.,You thought it was me?,And you didn't have any evidence of what happened then.,CHRISTIAN: Well, the world didn't,know I was a pervert then.,Also I hadn't punched you in the face two days earlier.,Well, what if we could convince the world,that you weren't a pervert?,[chuckles],How would we do that?,Lynda.,What?,STELLA: We say that Lynda was paranoid.,And that she was old and scared.,And that there were cameras all over every inch of the house,because she was terrified of the paparazzi pestering her.,And that she wanted to be left alone because she was sick.,I'm not going to do that to her.,She has a perfect, unblemished, reputation as a saint.,It won't ruin her reputation.,No one's going to blame a little old lady,for being paranoid of the paparazzi spying on her.,We say that someone, somehow, found the camera,in the bathroom.,They stole the memory card.,That we have no idea who it is.,No one's to blame.,And Lynda won't even remember the brief news blip.,If she even sees it.,It's not right.,It's also not right not telling Danny.,You can shut the f##k up.,You think you know everything?,You tell him.,Go put the cherry on the top of his already fan-f###ing-tastic,sundae.,That's what I thought.,And you know I'm right.,You know I'm right about Lynda.,You know the whole reason why Lynda,put the Foundation in my hands.,The whole reason why she isn't in the public eye,is because she wanted to be remembered,as Lynda Rue, the singer.,She didn't want everyone thinking of her as,,oh that beautiful singer who is now old and fragile.,That woman who used to be talented,,but has now lost her mind.,I won't let the last thing about her,in the world's collective consciousness,be that she was a paranoid freak who,kept cameras in her bathrooms.,That would be the ultimate betrayal to her.,Also I should probably stop lying.,STELLA: You're going to stop lying?,Yes.,STELLA: You're going to tell the truth about everything?,Yes.,STELLA: Do you like me?,CHRISTIAN: What?,Did I stutter?,You're ser-- you're seriously going to ask me that right now?,You're deflecting.,[chuckles],OK, I think it is seriously f###ed up,that you're laughing right now.,STELLA: And why is that?,Because my life is in ruins.,This whole thing is funny because none of this,would have happened if you weren't so afraid to answer,my first question.,I don't know what you're talking about.,You are a scared, scared, little child,under all that pervy exterior.,OK.,You can shut up now, really.,Now you're just being a b###h.,[unsettling music],[gasps],[moans],Mm.,Nuh-uh.,No don't.,Christian--,No don't touch me.,STELLA: You're a little damaged aren't you?,I think I preferred it when you called me a pervert.,STELLA: All right, then.,You're on your own.,It's your cross to bear.,First off, I'd like to thank you all for coming.,Five years ago Lynda Rue entrusted me,with her foundation.,I have broken that trust.,Everything you have heard, speculated, feared--,it's all true.,I am a creep.,I am a deviant.,A voyeur.,A pervert.,I will no longer be a liar.,In the guest bathroom I kept a hidden camera.,I am sure many of you wonder why I didn't just lie.,I could easily have chalked it up,to a little obsession with security.,I could even have blamed one of you.,It would have been easy.,Multiple people have told me that, but--,but I won't.,I won't do that to any of you.,You came here with purer intentions than I.,And though the world may judge you for those intentions.,I-- I want all of you to know that I have also,been caught with my pants down.,[chuckles],I wish I could have kept your secrets and my own safe,,but I failed.,Though I have made the decision to be honest,I must admit that not much else has changed.,I will continue despite everything,to hold events for the Foundation every month.,What?,And at each of these events After,Hours will continue as it has for your pleasure.,And in the guest bathroom there will be a camera.,Though now the guests will be checked,and the camera will be inspected to ensure,it still has its card.,Your secrets will remain within these walls,,but I will still be watching.,As I always have been since the very first event here,almost five years ago now.,If this does not suit you I will not judge any of you,for leaving.,While I have watched over each and every one of you,,though in ways to which you did not consent,,please know that no matter what act, environment, or object you,used to find your ecstasy I looked on you,with the eyes of an admirer.,Not the eyes of a judge.,I hope you can forgive me.,[chuckles],And extend this poor pervert the same freedom from judgment,even though I do not deserve it.,Thank you.,[sighs],LANCE: OK, that's it you're out.,Get-- hey.,[thumping],[groans],B1: Hey, hey, come on.,LANCE: Hey, hey.,B1: Let her go.,LANCE: OK, that's it.,Get out.,You're out of

X-Men 2 (2003) - full transcript,"Several months have passed since The X-Men defeated Magneto and imprisoned him in a seemingly impregnable plastic chamber. One day, a mutant by the name of Nightcrawler infiltrates the White House and attempts to assassinate the president, setting off a chain reaction of anti-mutant measures by the government. Meanwhile, Logan is trying to discover his past. As scientist named William Stryker discovers Professor X's secret school and Cerebro, Magneto's partner, Mystique, is planning to break her leader out of prison. But when Professor X's school is attacked by Stryker's forces, Logan, Rogue, Iceman and a few are lucky to escape. Those who remain meet in Boston, where they form an uneasy alliance with Magneto to stop Stryker and rescue Professor X.","Encoded by Judas,Enjoy!,Mutants.

X-Men: Days of Future Past (2014) - full transcript,"In the future, the mutants and the humans that help them are slaughtered by powerful robots named Sentinels. Professor Xavier, Wolverine, Magneto, Storm, Kitty Pryde and her friends meet at a monastery in China and Xavier explains that the invincible Sentinels were created using the DNA of Mystique that was captured in 1973 when she tried to assassinate their creator Dr. Bolivar Trask. Xavier tells that their only chance is return to 1973 using Pryde's ability to join Charles Xavier and Erik Lehnsherr to convince Mystique to give up of her intention. . However, only Wolverine can withstand the damages of the time travel.

of Light"",Zhang Guoqiang will show up.,You shouldn't let Qiang attend that match.,But it's OK,someone at his level,fight in this kind of match..,he could learn much.,This is ""the Ares of Light"",,Zhang Guoqiang.,There's an old saying:,Heroes what they are when they are very young.,We hope that Qiang,could make a great coup in this match.,Then let's see his opponent.,His opponent is obviously more mature than him.,""Knifekman on the Volcano"",Four,Last time I lose just because this bad boy?,2 meals, a week,Be good.,He is one of my two best men.,The meal for the week....,Please

forbidden.,Alright,please wear your teeth cover,,let's get ready for the fight.,The points Zhang Guoqiang loses,in this round is very precious.,The situation is no good for him.,And he is in the disadvantageous position all the time.,You see.,With this fall, the Red will win by 3 points.,Yes.,A Si is now using his knees in the attack.,This kind of attack won??t help him to win points,according to the rule of the match.,But it??s really effective,in weakening the opponent??s defensive power.,The Black??s counterattack doesn??t work at all.,As you can see??he has lose his CG(central of gravity).,I??ve heard about Zhang Guoqiang--that Champion of Striking Skills.,He??s just so so in my eyes.,But it is said that this Lightening Fighting Lord,has once been a Champion of Striking Skills.,Yes.,I feel that this honor may be,an obstacle for him to conquer mentally.,But under the circumstance of actual combat,,this kind of striking skill is just??,If he gives up now, he can only win half of the points.,Stop?,But you must promise me.,When I pay the money back, you can??t deny to accept it.,When I pay the money back, you can??t deny to accept it.,Four,Five,4??????,Now, the circumstance of the inside is that,The referee is asking Zhang Guoqiang,to have medical check immediately.,If he hurts badly??the match should be stopped.,It means that Zhang Guoqiang will lose the match.,Zhang Guoqiang didn??t play well,in this match.,What do you think of his future career?,I??m now getting more interested in his opponent--,A Si??s potential.,Lost 3 points again!,Stop?,Give up now! I can??t bear watching it any more.,Shame on you! Come back several years later,when you have mastered good striking skills.,Look??A Si??the Red,is now starting his combined attack.,Seems that Zhang Guoqiang can??t do any counterattack.,Zhang Guoqiang fouls.,Yes.,He has used his elbow.,The referee is warning Zhang Guoqiang.,No, he just wants to deduct Zhang Guoqiang by 1 point.,It seems that his name should be added to the list,which shows the ones,who have lost the most points in the free combat.,Yes.,He fouls again!,He hit on his opponent??s afterbrain.,He should lose1 point.,If Zhang Guoqiang continue doing so,,he may become the most points loss athletes in this match.,I can??t agree with you any more.,Why do you come here, auntie?,I don??t mean that.,You won??t let me to find him again, right?,I beg you, auntie.,You??d better learn from me.,Be cooler.,Please don??t talk, be a litter cooler.,That??s my fee of this match.,I??ll try to pay the left back to you soon.,You forehead is still bleeding.
