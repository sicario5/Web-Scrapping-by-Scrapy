One day, a mutant by the name of Nightcrawler infiltrates the White House and attempts to assassinate the president, setting off a chain reaction of anti-mutant measures by the government. Meanwhile, Logan is trying to discover his past. As scientist named William Stryker discovers Professor X's secret school and Cerebro, Magneto's partner, Mystique, is planning to break her leader out of prison. But when Professor X's school is attacked by Stryker's forces, Logan, Rogue, Iceman and a few are lucky to escape.

Xi He's mother fights for her son's right to a normal education despite his imperfection. She wants him to have the chance for a normal life. Back in the Chinese countryside, her brother suffers from autism and is hunted by the ignorant people from her village. Her old mother, unable to take care of him any longer, keeps him in a cage to keep him safe from others and from himself; like an animal. Tian Lin's childhood looms of memories tinted by her brother's life's effect on hers. She decides to teach Xi He herself, willing to do everything to save him from this destiny.", "transcript": ["Hello, Xihe.", "Now, let’s begin our class.", "Please open your textbook.", "Xihe.", "Please open your textbook.", "Xihe!", "Open your textbook.

{"title": "X-Men: The Last Stand (2006) - full transcript", "plot": "When a cure is created, which apparently can turn any mutant into a normal human being, there is outrage amongst the mutant community. Whilst some mutants do like the idea of a cure, including Rogue, many mutants find that there shouldn't be a cure. Magneto, who still believes a war is coming, recruits a large team of mutants to take down Warren Worthington II and his cure. Might seem easy for the X-Men to stop, but Magneto has a big advantage, which Wolverine doesn't have. Jean Grey has returned, and joined with Magneto. The Phoenix has woken within her, which has the ability to destroy anything in her way, even if that 'anything' is a X-Men.", "transcript": ["I still don't know", "why l'm here.", "Couldn't you just", "make them say yes?", "Yes, I could,", "but it's not my way.", "And I would expect you,", "of all people,", "would understand my feelings", "about the misuse of power.", "Ah, \"power corrupts\"", "and all that.", "Yes, I know, Charles.", "When are you going to", "stop lecturing me?", "When you start listening.", "And you're here", "because I need you.", "We're not gonna have to meet", "every one ofthem in person,", "are we?", "No. This one's special.", "What a beautiful campus.", "\n", "\n", "\n", "\n", "John, don't you think?", "Yes, the brochure is great.", "But what aboutJean?", "What about her... illness?", "- Illness?", "-John.", "You thinkyour daughter", "is sick, Mr. Grey?", "Perhaps it would be best if", "we were to speak to her, alone.", "Ofcourse.", "Jean?", "Can you come down, dear?", "We'll, uh, leave you then.", "It's very rude, you know, to read my", "thoughts or Mr. Lehnsherr's...", "without our permission.", "Did you think", "you were the only one", "ofyour kind, young lady?", "We're mutants,Jean.", "We are like you.", "Really?", "I doubt that.", "Oh, Charles.", "\n", "\n", "\n", "\n", "I like this one.", "You have more power", "than you can imagine,Jean.", "The question is,", "will you control that power...", "or let it control you?", "Warren?

{"title": "XIII: The Conspiracy (2008) - full transcript", "plot": "The first female US President Sally Sheridan is shot dead by a sniper during her Veterans Day speech. Her assassin narrowly escapes the scene with his life, national security hot on his heels - or so it seems. Three months later, an elderly couple discover the body of a wounded man in a tree, wearing a parachute. The young man (Dorff) cannot remember the slightest thing about his own identity. The only clue is a tattoo on his neck, \"XIII\". Meanwhile, in the Whitehouse, government intelligence is still conducting the search for the President's killer. With the elections just weeks away, a confirmed suspect could swing the vote for the administration. Hours after XIII's location is picked up by covert intelligence, elite special ops forces are swarming the couple's house in Cape Fear. Running on adrenaline and instinct, XIII tactically takes out the soldiers one by one. On the run, clinging to one desperate clue after another, XIII begins to piece back his life, fragments of his memory returning. Finally captured, he learns that he has been given a stolen identity and placed undercover to flush out a group of conspirators threatening to overthrow the government. Ensconced within the highest echelons of power the conspirators run their own security agency alongside the Government's. Both are out to find him. The only way for XIII to get his own life back is to play bait. A dangerous game, especially when you don't know who you really are.", "transcript": ["Thank you.", "Today we honor the 25 million veterans", "who have worn the uniform of", "the United States of America.", "I am especially thankful", "to be back home", "honoring two veterans", "from my own family.", "My father,", "former Senator Henry Sheridan and,", "of course, my brother Wally Sheridan,", "Governor of this great state.", "We observe Veteran's Day", "on a special anniversary.", "A day when war ended", "and our nation was..", "This morning I asked my Secretary", "of Defence, Ellery Shipley,", "to formulate a schedule", "for the gradual withdrawal", "\n", "\n", "\n", "\n", "of our troops from Afghanistan", "and Iraq.", "As Commander-in-Chief", "it is my responsibility", "to protect the protectors.", "The men and women of the armed forces.", "Our troops have served valiantly.", "Now it is time to bring them home.", "So on this Veterans' Day", "let us give thanks to", "all those men and women", "who have fought to ensure our freedom.", "May God bless them and their families.", "May God bless", "the United States of America.", "Sally.", "The President is down.", "Again, we are still", "waiting for confirmation,", "but it appears that a shot", "or some shots were fired.", "\n", "\n", "\n", "\n", "Secret Service has mobilized", "and is taking her to safety.", "He's coming down.", "Did you get him?", "No.", "A special meeting of Congress", "has convened in Washington today..", "...Congress..
